<center><h1>The difference between CSS and HTML</h1></center>
<br>
<h3><p>HTML is the structure of the page and CSS is the style.</p>
<p>HTML is used to structure the content on the web page.HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the language that is used to define the structure of a web page.
 HTML is used along with CSS and Javascript to design web pages. HTML is the basic building block of a website. It has different attributes and elements with different properties.
 Each element has an opening and a closing tag. We can also add images with the help of HTML. 
 <p>CSS is used to add style to the content of a web pageCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to style web documents.
 It is used to provide the background color and is also used for styling. It can also be used to style the font and change its size.
 We can also style many different web pages with the same specifications with the help of CSS. CSS is also recommended by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
 It can also be used along with HTML and Javascript to design web pages. .</p>
<p>CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text.
 Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics.
 HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language.</p></h3>
